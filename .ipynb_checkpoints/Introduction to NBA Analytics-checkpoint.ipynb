    "Data science, broadly speaking, is the field that uses the scientific method to extract novel insights from data sets. Machine learning, a subset of data science, uses data to generate interesting predictions, classifications, and decisions. While certain [figures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZf9NFaCQHQ) remain staunchly opposed to the use of analytics in the NBA, for the most part, the NBA is embracing the use of analytics and machine learning. For example, a company called [Second Spectrum](https://www.secondspectrum.com/). Second Spectrum is using deep learning models to measure shot efficiency and classify pick-and-roll defensive schemes. I recommend [this ted talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/rajiv_maheswaran_the_math_behind_basketball_s_wildest_moves).\n",

    "The main tool we will use in data science is the programming language Python. While data scientists use a broad range of tools, ranging from Excel, MATLAB, Python, and R, Python offers a few key advantages, namely being very flexible and easy to learn. For more information about Python, please to the Python [website](http://kevindurant.com/).\n",

    "Python also has the benefit of allowing users to use \"IPython notebooks\" - think of these as the programming equivalent of lab notebooks you would use in a traditional science class. These notebooks can be shared with others, and it's easy to view and modify the steps that are performed in the data science process. In fact, this guide is an IPython notebook. More information about IPython notebooks can be found [here](https://ipython.org/notebook.html).\n",

    "The first step is to get as much quality NBA data as you can. The bigger the data, the better. This is not as easy as it sounds. You'll almost never find clean, processed data in the wild. Often times, you'll have to scrape it from different reference sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best possible scenario is that the NBA has a public, well documented API for getting as much data as you could possibly need. Unfortunately, they don't, so we will have to settle for grit n' grind methods. Generally, you will need to query a stats.nba.com or basketball-reference.com endpoint with some parameters, and you'll get a JSON back with data. Unfortunately, the REST APIs for stats.nba.com and basketball-reference hav no documentation, so it's up to the user to figure out 1) what endpoints to query, 2) what sort of parameters these endpoints take, 3) what the resulting data looks like. \n",
    "\n",
    "1) Using various APIs for stats.nba.com and basketball reference: A variety of python-facing APIs exist for querying stats.nba.com and basketball-reference.com. A quick google search will give you a few options. Since many of these APIs are not in a mature development stage, I will not devote much time to them. However, the aspiring NBA data scraper may find them useful. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Someone on the internet put together a nice Swagger UI that documents a large portion of the endpoints of stats.nba.com API [here](http://danielwelch.github.io/little-pynny/). Documentation can be found [here](http://danielwelch.github.io/documenting-the-nba-stats-api.html). The issue with this is that even though the endpoints and parameters are documented, we still don't know exactly what the endpoints give us and what type of values for the parameters we need to provide. Let's try to get some player statistics."
